# Steam API
A simple program that retrieves public information from other steam accounts using steam's web API in Python 3

<h1>What's this?</h1>
<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a> is a digital distribution platform for games that also provides social networking services.
Steam also provides <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/dev" target="_blank">APIs</a> in which developers have access to their public data and data of their users.</p>
I created this program for anyone who wants to easily retrieve public information for a steam account.

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
You will need Python 3.x.x for this program to work
<h4>Installing Python</h4>

<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>Simply clone the repository or download the zip file to a directory on your computer. Once you've extracted the contents into a folder open up your console/terminal in the same directory and simply type 'py steamapi.py' into your console/terminal and the program should begin.</p>
