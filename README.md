# Steam API
A simple program that retrieves public information from other steam accounts using steam's web API in Python 3

<h2>What's this?</h2>
<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a> is a digital distribution platform for games that also provides social networking services.
Steam also provides <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/dev" target="_blank">APIs</a> in which developers have access to their public data and data of their users.</p>
I created this program for anyone who wants to easily retrieve public information for a steam account.

<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>Simply clone the repository or download to a directory on your computer, and once you've extracted the contents in a folder, open up your console/terminal in the same directory, then simply type 'py steamapi.py' into your console/terminal and the program will begin.</p>
<br>
<p>Other things to note is that you will need a Steam API Key for this program to work.</p>
<p>The program should be cross-platform where it should work on Linux/MAC OS and Windows</p>
